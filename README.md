### Python Scripts

The `src/` directory contains the following Python scripts:

- **`extract_ei_spold_data.py`**: Contains classes and methods to extract data from SPOLD files.
- **`elementary_flow_processor.py`**: Processes elementary flows to calculate compositions and handle exclusions.
- **`intermediate_flow_processor.py`**: Processes intermediate exchanges, converting units and calculating compositions.

These scripts are imported and used within the Jupyter notebook to perform the data processing tasks.
